## Technical Implementation

### Components Structure
```
src/pages/customer/
├── CustomerPrescriptions.tsx    # Main prescriptions dashboard
├── UploadPrescription.tsx       # Multi-step upload interface
└── PendingPrescriptions.tsx     # Real-time pending tracker
```

### Key Technologies Used
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Ant Design** for consistent UI components
- **React Router v6** for navigation
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Mock Data Integration** for development testing

### Data Models
```typescript
interface Prescription {
  id: string;
  patientName: string;
  doctorName: string;
  medications: Medication[];
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'ready' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  uploadDate: string;
  files: PrescriptionFile[];
  priority: 'normal' | 'urgent' | 'emergency';
  estimatedCompletion?: string;
  queuePosition?: number;
}
```

### Navigation Integration
The prescription management system is fully integrated into the main navigation menu:
- **My Prescriptions**: View all prescriptions with filtering
- **Upload New**: Start new prescription upload process
- **Pending**: Track prescriptions awaiting pharmacist review

## User Experience Features

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly interface with adaptive layouts
- Touch-friendly upload areas for tablet users
- Optimized for various screen sizes

### Accessibility
- Screen reader compatible components
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast status indicators
- Alt text for all images and icons

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for prescription pages
- Efficient file handling with progress indicators
- Optimized re-renders with proper React patterns
- Auto-refresh with configurable intervals

## Mock Data for Development
The system includes comprehensive mock data for testing:
- **25+ Sample Prescriptions** with varied statuses and medications
- **Realistic Doctor Database** with specialties and contact information
- **Diverse Medication List** with dosages and instructions
- **File Attachments** simulation for different file types

## Future Enhancements
1. **Real Backend Integration**: Replace mock data with actual API calls
2. **Push Notifications**: Real-time status updates via WebSocket
3. **Prescription History Export**: PDF/CSV export functionality
4. **Medication Reminders**: Integration with calendar systems

6. **Pharmacy Communication**: Direct messaging with pharmacists

## Testing Scenarios
To test the system:
1. **Login as Customer**: Use the customer role to access prescription features
2. **Upload Test**: Try uploading different file types and sizes
3. **Navigation Test**: Ensure all menu items lead to correct pages
4. **Status Filtering**: Test filtering prescriptions by different statuses
5. **Responsive Test**: Check mobile and tablet layouts

## Development Notes
- All components use TypeScript for type safety
- Ant Design components ensure consistent styling
- Mock authentication system for development testing
- Error handling implemented for file uploads and API calls
- Loading states provided for better user experience

The prescription management system provides a complete, production-ready foundation that can be easily connected to a real backend API when available.
